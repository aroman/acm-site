  <p>1 (one; play /ˈwʌn/ or UK /ˈwɒn/) is a number, numeral, and the name of the glyph representing that number. It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement. For example, a line segment of "unit length" is a line segment of length 1.</p>

  Two has many properties in mathematics.[1] An integer is called even if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number, such as decimal and hexadecimal, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit. If it is even, then the whole number is even. In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

  Two is the smallest and the first prime number, and the only even one[2] (for this reason it is sometimes called "the oddest prime"[3]). The next prime is three. Two and three are the only two consecutive prime numbers. 2 is the first Sophie Germain prime, the first factorial prime, the first Lucas prime, and the first Smarandache-Wellin prime. It is an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form 3n − 1. It is also a Stern prime, a Pell number, the first Fibonacci prime, and a Markov number, appearing in infinitely many solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation involving odd-indexed Pell numbers.

  Three is often the largest number written with as many lines as the number represents. The Romans tired of writing 4 as IIII, instead using IV, but to this day 3 is written as three lines in Roman and Chinese numerals. This was the way the Brahmin Indians wrote it, and the Gupta made the three lines more curved. The Nagari started rotating the lines clockwise and ending each line with a slight downward stroke on the right. Eventually they made these strokes connect with the lines below, and evolved it to a character that looks very much like a modern 3 with an extra stroke at the bottom. It was the Western Ghubar Arabs who finally eliminated the extra stroke and created our modern 3.

    ACM partners with employers to provide students networking and, ultimately, employment  opportunities. We host both large and small scale events that provide intimate access to highly  competitive and sought after employers. Types of past events that we've hosted include  information sessions, programming competitions and tech talks. ACM also hosts private  networking events with companies for active members. All our events are well stocked with  food. Check out a list of our partners below.

  <h2>Making it in the Real World</h2>
  <p>
ACM partners with employers to provide students networking and, ultimately, employment  opportunities. We host both large and small scale events that provide intimate access to highly  competitive and sought after employers. Types of past events that we've hosted include  information sessions, programming competitions and tech talks. ACM also hosts private  networking events with companies for active members. All our events are well stocked with  food. Check out a list of our partners below.

<h2>We Know How to Have a Good Time</h2>
  <p>
While much of what ACM does it career or self development oriented, we understand the importance of friends and relaxation. ACM often hosts get-togethers including bonding dinners, frisbee, Kinect parties.

<h2>More Than Just Code</h2>
  <p>
At ACM, we're passionate about technology and service. We develop applications that benefit the Carnegie Mellon Community at large. Our current applications (including this website) have primarily been developed in Ruby on Rails but we are open to and welcome all technologies. Check out a few of our applications below!
